<h2 id="Forloop">For loop</h2>
<p>In computer science a for-loop or for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration. Specifically, a for
    loop functions by running a section of code repeatedly until a certain condition has been satisfied.

    For-loops have two parts: a header and a body. The header defines the iteration and the body is the code that is
    executed once per iteration. The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable. This allows the
    body to know which iteration is being executed. For-loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known
    before entering the loop. For-loops can be thought of as shorthands for while-loops which increment and test a loop
    variable.</p><a href="#top">Top</a>
<h2 id="whileloop">while loop</h2>
<p>The while construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression.[1] The condition/expression is evaluated,
    and if the condition/expression is true,[1] the code within all of their following in the block is executed. This
    repeats until the condition/expression becomes false. Because the while loop checks the condition/expression before
    the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop. Compare this with the do while
    loop, which tests the condition/expression after the loop has executed.

    For example, in the C programming language (as well as Java, C#,[2] Objective-C, and C++, which use the same syntax
    in this case), the code fragment.</p><a href="#top">Top</a>
<h2 id="dowhileloop">do while loop</h2>
<p>The do while construct consists of a process symbol and a condition. First the code within the block is executed.
    Then the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true the code within the block is executed again. This repeats
    until the condition becomes false.

    Do while loops check the condition after the block of code is executed. This control structure can be known as a
    post-test loop. This means the do-while loop is an exit-condition loop. However a while loop will test the condition
    before the code within the block is executed.</p><a href="#top">Top</a>
<h2 id="Assigment Operator">Assigment Operator</h2>
<p>The copy assignment operator, often just called the "assignment operator", is a special case of assignment operator
    where the source (right-hand side) and destination (left-hand side) are of the same class type. It is one of the
    special member functions, which means that a default version of it is generated automatically by the compiler if the
    programmer does not declare one. The default version performs a memberwise copy, where each member is copied by its
    own copy assignment operator (which may also be programmer-declared or compiler-generated).</p><a
    href="#top">Top</a>
<h2 id="Relational Operator">Relational Operator</h2>
<p>In computer science, a relational operator is a programming language construct or operator that tests or defines some
    kind of relation between two entities. These include numerical equality (e.g., 5 = 5) and inequalities (e.g., 4 ≥
    3).

    In programming languages that include a distinct boolean data type in their type system, like Pascal, Ada, or Java,
    these operators usually evaluate to true or false, depending on if the conditional relationship between the two
    operands holds or not. In languages such as C, relational operators return the integers 0 or 1, where 0 stands for
    false and any non-zero value stands for true.</p><a href="#top">Top</a>
<h2 id="unary Operator">unary Operator</h2>
<p>In mathematics, an unary operation is an operation with only one operand, i.e. a single input.[1] This is in contrast
    to binary operations, which use two operands.[2] An example is any function f : A → A, where A is a set. The
    function f is a unary operation on A.

    Common notations are prefix notation (e.g. ¬, −), postfix notation (e.g. factorial n!), functional notation (e.g.
    sin x or sin(x)), and superscripts (e.g. transpose AT). Other notations exist as well, for example, in the case of
    the square root, a horizontal bar extending the square root sign over the argument can indicate the extent of the
    argument.</p><a href="#top">Top</a>
<h2 id="Bitwise Operator">Bitwise Operator</h2>
<P>In computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on a bit string, a bit array or a binary numeral (considered as
    a bit string) at the level of its individual bits. It is a fast and simple action, basic to the higher-level
    arithmetic operations and directly supported by the processor. Most bitwise operations are presented as two-operand
    instructions where the result replaces one of the input operands.</P><a href="#top">Top</a>
<h2 id="Logical operator">Logical operator</h2>
<p>A logical operator is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions such that the value of the compound
    expression produced depends only on that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator.[1] Common
    logical operators include AND.</p><a href="#top">Top</a>
